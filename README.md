# Magic 8 Ball App

Welcome to the Magic 8 Ball app, a simple iOS application developed as a part of Angela Yu's Udemy iOS 13 Development Course. This app is designed to replicate the fun and mystique of the classic "Magic 8 Ball" toy, providing users with random answers to their questions.

## App Description

The Magic 8 Ball app allows users to ask a yes-or-no question and shake their device to receive a random answer. The app features a collection of predefined answers that mimic the responses of the original Magic 8 Ball toy, providing entertainment and amusement.

## Features

- Interactive response: Users can ask a question by typing it in and then shaking their device to see a random response.
- Randomization: The app selects a response from a predefined list of answers to simulate the unpredictability of the original Magic 8 Ball toy.

## Development Environment

To run the Magic 8 Ball app on your local machine, you will need:

- Xcode: Make sure you have Xcode installed, as it's the primary development environment for iOS apps.
- Swift: The app is developed using the Swift programming language, so familiarity with Swift basics is helpful.
- UIKit: The app uses UIKit for building the user interface.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.
4. Type a yes-or-no question and shake the device to see the Magic 8 Ball's response.

## App Structure

The app's codebase is organized as follows:

- **Main.storyboard**: Contains the main user interface layout, including the text field and response label.
- **ViewController.swift**: Handles the logic for generating random responses and updating the user interface.
